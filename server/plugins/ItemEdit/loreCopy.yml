# Some server admins finds faster to compile a file configuration rather than using commands
# so this file is where you can configure text to paste later
# Reload configurations with '/itemeditreload'
#
# Pay attention to indentation and avoid 'TAB' char otherwise file may break and unexpected behavior should be expected
# (don't worry the maximus damage you can do is break '/ie lore copyfile' until you reset this file)
# The <path> is required to specify which configuration you wish to copy
#
# Usefull Symbols:
# ⛏ ☆ ✧ ✗ ✓
