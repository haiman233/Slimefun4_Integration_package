# This example is for colours and formatting in Skript.
# Skript allows the old-style Minecraft codes using `&`, like &0 for black and &l for bold.
# You can also use <> for colours and formats, like `<red>` for red and `<bold>` for bold
#
# In Minecraft 1.16, support was added for 6-digit hexadecimal colors to specify custom colors other than the 16 default color codes.
# The tag for these colors looks like this: <##hex code> e.g. `<##123456>`
#

command /color:
    permission: skript.example.color
    trigger:
        send "&6This message is golden."
        send "<light red><bold>This message is light red and bold."
        send "<##FF0000>This message is red."

#
# Other formatting options are also available.
# You can create clickable text, which opens a website or execute a command, or even show a tool tip when hovering over the text.
#

command /forum:
    permission: skript.example.link
    trigger:
        send "To visit the website, [<link:https://google.com><tooltip:click here>click here<reset>]"

command /copy <text>:
    permission: skript.example.copy
    trigger:
        # Insertion: when the player shift clicks on the message, it will add the text to their text box.
        # To use variables and other expressions with these tags, you have to send the text as `formatted`.
        send formatted "<insertion:%arg-1%>%arg-1%"

command /suggest:
    permission: skript.example.suggest
    trigger:
        send "<cmd:/say hi>Click here to run the command /say hi"
        send "<sgt:/say hi>Click here to suggest the command /say hi"
